Hello. This is smp, my personal attempt at centralizing
and curating my sample collection.

It works like this:

Samples are almost exclusively WAV files.

More often then not, samples are in self-contained
collections.

These collections each have their own folder, and
are contained their own SQLar file. Due to their size,
these will mostly exist on external storage mediums.

SQLar archives can be copied over and merged together
in one giant SQLar archive. This is to be used as a
centralized location for retrieving samples.

Every file in a SQLar archive gets imported into a WeeWiki
Zettelkasten (Zet) via the WeeWiki Crate interface. Just
the filename, not the contents itself.

Once inside the WeeWiki, sample curation can begin. The
WeeWiki has two main formats to do this. The ZettelKasten
allows for granular timestamped annotation for individual
samples. Samples can be arbitrarily linked together and
placed in groups. The wiki allows for more long-form writing
and higher level ideas. There is also a Janet scripting
interface, which can allow the wiki to dynamically display
things from the zet in HTML form.
