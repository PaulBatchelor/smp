#+TITLE: smp
This is the main landing page for smp, my personal
catalogue of curated samples.

I'm just getting started, there's not much more to
say at the moment right now.

Compared to my usual wikis, this one has less automation.

rather than relying on the dump functionality, wikis are
manually generated. This means that every wikipage has an
external org file that is tracked via Fossil.

The zettelkasten is going to be interesting. It's exported
to a TSV file and is going to get big very quickly. It also
needs to be manually dumped with the script =dump_zet.sh=.
Will have to rethink this at some point.
