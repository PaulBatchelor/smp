#+TITLE: Usage
How to use this thing.

This is a specially managed weewiki and zet. Careful usage
is required.

Writing stuff down as I go.

Utilities are stored in the "u" folder. These
are small shell scripts wrapped around weewiki that
do specific things.

Most of what happens here is making logs. Do this
with =u/zsay=.

It is *very* important that you tie whatever is being
said to *exactly one* group that gets explicitely
exported. If you don't, the message will get erased. If
you link more than one, it will get duplicated in the repo.

For general messages, use the =logs= tag.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
u/zsay @logs
#+END_SRC

Logs are also tied to specific sqlar groups.

Be sure to periodically dump the zet with =dumpzet.sh=.

If you don't do this, stuff won't be saved.
