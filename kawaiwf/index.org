The original text as follows:

The Kawai K1 was my first  real  synthesizer. Prior to that
I had only ever played with my Casio MT-18 and compared to
that, the Kawai K1 was endless palette of awesome sounds.
It began a long love affair with Kawai synthesizers and
ultimately I ve owned all of them at some point in time.
They re all gone now, replaced by other synths with better
interfaces and features but my love for the sounds the
Kawai K1 produced has stayed strong over the years. So,
prior to selling my last Kawai K1r last year, I took the
time to sample each of it s single cycle waveforms, single
shot samples and loops. 256 samples in all.

They are all presented here as 44.1khz 24bit wave files
along with a PDF file of a document that came along with
the original K1 s detailing all of the samples. Enjoy.
